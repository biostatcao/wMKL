Description:
    Cancer is known as the heterogenous disease driven by complex molecular alterations. 
    Cancer subtypes determined from multi-omics data integration analysis can provide novel insight for personalized medicine.
    It is recognized that incorporating prior weight into multi-omics data integration can improve disease subtyping. 
    Here we develop a weighted method, termed as prior-weight-boosted Multi-Kernel Learning (wMKL) 
	which can incorporate heterogenous data types as well as flexible weight functions, 
	to boost subtype identification. Given a series of weight functions, 
	we propose an omnibus combination strategy to integrate different weight related p-values. 
	The integrated p-values for features are then applied to update the weighted similarity kernel.
