Description:
    Cancer is known as the heterogenous disease driven by complex molecular alterations. 
    Cancer subtypes determined from multi-omics data integration analysis can provide novel insight for personalized medicine.
    It is recognized that incorporating prior weight into multi-omics data integration can improve disease subtyping. 
    Here we develop such a weighted method, which we refer to as prior weight-boosted Multikernel LeaRning (wMLR). 
    wMLR can incorporate heterogenous data types as well as flexible weight functions to boost subtype identification, 
    providing a generic weighted modeling method.
